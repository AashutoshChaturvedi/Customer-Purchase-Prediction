# Customer Purchase Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral features using Logistic Regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Data creation and understanding
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
4. Train-test split
5. Logistic Regression model training
6. Model evaluation using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC
7. Threshold tuning based on business requirement

## Key Outcome
The model achieved a good ROC-AUC score and demonstrated effective separation between purchase and non-purchase customers.
