# \# Customer Purchase Prediction using Logistic Regression

# 

# \## 📌 Project Overview

# This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning classification solution that predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral features.  

# The model is built using Logistic Regression and evaluated using multiple performance metrics to align predictions with business objectives.

#

# 

# \## 🎯 Business Problem

# Marketing teams often struggle to identify which customers are most likely to make a purchase.  

# Targeting the wrong customers increases marketing costs, while missing potential buyers results in lost revenue.

# 

# \*\*Goal:\*\*  

# Predict customer purchase behavior and support data-driven marketing decisions.

#

# 

# \## 📊 Dataset Description

# A structured customer dataset was created containing the following features:

# 

# | Feature | Description |

# |-------|------------|

# | Age | Customer age |

# | Salary | Annual income of the customer |

# | Visits | Number of website visits |

# | Purchased | Target variable (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |

#

# \## 🧠 Concepts \& Techniques Used

# \- Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Standard Deviation)

# \- Probability \& Conditional Probability

# \- Correlation vs Causation

# \- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)

# \- Train-Test Split

# \- Logistic Regression

# \- Model Evaluation:

# &nbsp; - Confusion Matrix

# &nbsp; - Accuracy

# &nbsp; - Precision

# &nbsp; - Recall

# &nbsp; - F1-Score

# &nbsp; - ROC-AUC

# \- Threshold Tuning for business optimization

# \## 📈 Model Performance (Sample Results)

# \- Accuracy: ~70%

# \- Precision: ~80%

# \- Recall: ~67%

# \- F1-Score: ~73%

# \- ROC-AUC: ~0.82

# 

# > ROC-AUC was used as the primary evaluation metric due to its robustness on classification problems.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## 💡 Business Insights

# \- Customers with higher salary and frequent visits show a higher likelihood of purchase.

# \- Threshold tuning helped reduce missed potential buyers.

# \- The model can assist marketing teams in prioritizing high-probability customers.
